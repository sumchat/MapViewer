* This application is used to display a list of maps that are created and stored in ArcGIS Online.
* User can choose on a map in the map Gallery and will display the map in detail.
* The map will show line, point and polygon features. 
* Any featutre can be identified by selecting it. But for line it will also draw a profile by querying the elevation values using REST API call.
* Then there is a option to add a geofence reminder at any feature. Once added it is stored in a local database and a buffer of 1 mile is drawn around the point 
* You can also delete a reminder from the list.
